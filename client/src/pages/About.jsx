          About the Smart Election Face Recognition System
        </h2>

        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          We are using this Smart Election Face Recognition System to provide a safer,
          more accessible, and efficient voting experience for everyone. With this
          web-based platform, even citizens living abroad or those unable to travel
          can cast their votes securely from their own location.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          By integrating face recognition technology, we reduce the risk of voter fraud
          and enhance trust in the electoral process. This system not only ensures
          security but also increases voter turnout, empowering more people to participate
          in choosing their government.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mt-10 mb-2">Why Face Recognition?</h3>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Traditional voting methods can be time-consuming and sometimes unreliable.
          With face recognition, we ensure each voter is verified uniquely and securely.
          It eliminates duplicate votes and impersonation, ensuring transparency and fairness.
        </p>
